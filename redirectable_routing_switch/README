Redirectable routing switch
===========================

REDIRECTABLE ROUTING SWITCH IS AN EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION AND
MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH C AND SQL,
WE STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO RUN THIS APPLICATION.

This directory includes an OpenFlow controller that emulates a single
large layer 2 switch consists of arbitrary number of OpenFlow switches
with a redirection functions. The redirection function allows us to
redirect traffic coming from unauthorized hosts to be redirected to
controller's local IP protocol stack. By redirecting traffic, for
example, you can monitor traffic coming from unauthorized hosts.

# How to build

  Build Trema first
  $ git clone git://github.com/trema/trema.git trema
  $ cd trema
  $ ./build.rb
  $ cd ..

  Build redirectable routing switch and create authorized host database
  $ make
  $ ./create_authorized_host_db.sh
  $ sqlite3 ./authorized_host.db
  (Add authorized hosts manually...)

# How to run

  $ cd trema
  $ sudo ./trema run -c ../rectable_routing_switch.conf

Enjoy!
